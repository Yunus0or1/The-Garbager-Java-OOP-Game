Story :

A robot is placed in sylhet city to clean up the garbage,polluted water and plant new trees.
Use WASD to move the player
Place the player near any garbage and use Arrow[up,down,right,left] to clean up the garbage.

I have not included jar file here because jar file of this project can not load the images.
So it will be best if someone opens the full java file as the project by Netbeans or eclipse.
But one can find the jar file here inside The Garbager\dist folder.

A basic Java OOP game.
Enjoy.
