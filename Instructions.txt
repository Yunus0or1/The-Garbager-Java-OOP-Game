********************************  Important Instructions  ************************************

I have not included jar file here because jar file of this project can not load the images.
Because the ImageLoader classes use relative path and jar file can not copy the resource file.


You can not also use terminal to run this project as running from terminal will show hundreds
of errors because of not finding all the classess.

So it will be best if someone opens the full java file as the project by Netbeans or eclipse.

Open the project with netbeans/eclipse. Expand The Garbager, then expand Source Packages ->
dev.Driden.project -> GameCode.java. You can find the main method here. Clean, build and run
the project.


A basic Java OOP game. This was my first project. 
Enjoy.
